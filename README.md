## Description

It's a block diagram of time delay system.

## Motivation

Time-delays appear in many engineering systems - aircraft, chemical control
systems, in lasers models, in internet, biology, medicine ...
There can be transport, communication or measurement delay. It's important to analyze these systems. 

## Results

Here's transmitter - x(t) and receiver - y(t) with different coupling coefficient k. We can see chaotic synchronization.

k = 0
